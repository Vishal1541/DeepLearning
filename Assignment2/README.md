# Assignment 1
Open the `CS671_Assignment_2__2019_.pdf` for the problem statements. Codes for task1, task2 are in the folder `Task1_CNN`, `Task2_MultiHead` respectively.

## Guide on how to run

### Language
Make sure you have `Python 3` setup in your `Jupyter Notebook`.

### Libraries used
Following are the python libraries used:
```bash
numpy, os, cv2
```
### Run the program
   -   Before running codes for task 1 and task 2, first `extract_line_data.ipynb` and `extract_line_data_4classes.ipynb` should be run to get the ground truth.
   -   Open the `extract_line_data.ipynb` in the `Jupyter Notebook` and run all the cells. A folder `line_data` would be then created which contains ground truth for training and testing data.
   -   Open the `extract_line_data_4classes.ipynb` in the `Jupyter Notebook` and run all the cells. A folder `line_data_4classes` would be then created which contains ground truth for training and testing data for each of the 4 classification heads.
